# **App Name**: EthicalDriveAI

## Core Features:

- Object Detection: Detect and classify road entities (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights) using YOLOv8n or OpenCV.
- Scenario Summarization: Convert perception data into human-readable ethical scenarios using an LLM to summarize the situation and moral dilemma. This can use a tool to minimize total harm.
- Ethical Reasoning Engine: Apply symbolic reasoning and ethical rules (utilitarian, deontological) to determine the optimal driving action.
- Decision Interface: Output the final decision (e.g., Brake, Continue, Stop) along with a reasoning explanation in natural language.
- Real-time Visualization: Display a live video feed with detected objects, the ethical decision, a textual explanation of the reasoning, and confidence metrics.
- Neuro-Symbolic Integration: Connect the neural network (perception) outputs to the symbolic reasoning inputs for seamless data flow.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trustworthiness and intelligence, reflecting the seriousness of ethical decisions.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF1), providing a neutral backdrop that reduces visual distraction.
- Accent color: Vivid orange (#FF5722) to highlight critical information, such as warnings or the AI's decision, ensuring visibility and quick recognition.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, offering a modern, machined, objective, and neutral look, suitable for clear communication in both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, standardized icons for road entities (pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights) to ensure quick recognition. Icons should follow a flat design style to maintain a clean interface.
- Implement a clean, modular layout. Live video feed on the left, ethical decision and explanation on the right. Ensure that the important information is presented at the top of the page.
- Subtle animations for updating the decision and explanation text. Avoid any distracting effects. Animation should be used sparingly to enhance clarity and comprehension.
